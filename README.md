Sathra Design Guidelines
-----------

* **Simple:** Simple things should stay simple. Sathra deals with direct api calls to physics and graphics library.
* **Feature rich:** Simple doesn't mean poor. Sathra includes tools for all core parts 2D games need.
* **Data-driven:** With builtin serialization system, you are able to build complete scenes, with graphics, animations, physics and AI entirely in JSON! Loading and saving custom objects, requires minimum ingerention in your code and comes down to adding proper annotation to your class' constructor.
* **2D only:** Sathra is specifically designed for 2D games, meaning you can focus on development and not dealing with unnecessary stuff to make your game work.

Technologies
-----------

Sathra benefits from following technologies:

* Non-ingerent JSON serialization system
* OpenGL ES 2.0 graphics
* Behaviour trees AI
* Dyn4j physics
* JavaScript embeded scripting
